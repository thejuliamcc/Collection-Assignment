      <p> I started to collect rabbit
        paraphernalia before I owned a bunny. I got my first real bunny in 2015. His name is Ragnar. </p>
      <p> Although it may seem so, I don’t collect indiscriminately. These bunny plates, for example, I did not
        purchase.
        Although they’re adorable (and maybe it’s gross sentimentalism at work), there is a certain weirdness missing.
      </p>
      <p> I saw them at Craftworks outside of Peterborough. Maybe I’ll change my mind and go get them.</p>
      <p> These two buns were also acquired at Prudhommes, off the QEW. Here they are in their natural habitat, but I
        did
        take them home shortly afterward. </p>
      <p> I enjoy seasonal decorations, which are ripe grounds for tackiness. I pull out my bunny decor when the snow
        first melts. I also have pastel-toned clowns that I call my Spring Clowns. </p>
