      <p> The first time I saw clowns I wanted was in Niederbusch. They were called Gildeclowns. It was 2011. I bought
        three. </p>
      <p> None of these pictures are my Gildeclowns. The top 3 were given to me by my mother-in-law, the second set of 3
        I’ve forgotten. The bottom row was a gift from my aunt. There’s also a Jack Skellington in there because it was
        Halloween. </p>
      <p> These two are recent acquisitions from Prudhommes Antique Market. The previous owner of the larger clown
        seemed
        pretty adamant that I buy it. The smaller fellow I found a few weeks ago at another Prudhommes stall. The
        similiar
        colour scheme was what drew me to it. </p>
      <p> Neither of them have labels to say where they were made. </p>
      <p> The rest of my clowns are in storage.</p>
